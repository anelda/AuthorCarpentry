#Author Carpentry                ![Author Carpentry Logo](AClogo.jpg)

Welcome to the master repository for [Author Carpentry] (http://libguides.caltech.edu/authorcarpentry), a training initiatve  of the Caltech Library to enhance scientific authorship and publishing in the digital age. The aim of Author Carpentry is to promote and support good information handling tools, practices, and skills that help researchers prepare, submit, and publish contributions that add value to the scholarly record and invite others to adapt and build upon. Ideally, that means contributions that fulfill not only the original Big Four of the scientific paper --

1. Registration

2. Validation

3. Dissemination

4. Preservation

*But also enable an essential fifth component of knowledge management in the digital age*:

5. Replication, Reuse, and Remixing

In conceiving of the Author Carpentry program, our hope is to advance production and curatation of the *Research Paper of the Future*, crafted as a fully open, executable, reproducible, reusable contribution ready to be rendered, tested, mined, adapted, and built upon by humans and machines. 

Author Carpentry lessons are agnostic to the mode of 'publication', recognizing that the term connotes a range of dissemination choices in the Internet Age (self-archiving in a pre-print server, sharing via a reputable online repository, micro publication on a blog, tweet, or other web service, or by peer-reviewed journal or referreed book.) 

#Connection between Author Carpentry and Software/Data Carpentry

The success of Software and Data Carpentry in teaching scientists good enough skills for effective software and data creation and management has inspired the Caltech Library to recast its Author Academy program in a complementary approach. The Author Carpentry lessons are intended to serve as snap-on modules to enhance an existing SW/D Carpentry workshop. SWC founder Greg Wilson's draft lesson [Modern Scientific Authoring] (http://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/01-mess.html) speaks to the need for training in research information handling.  Subsequent discussions with members of the Carpentry and Research Data Alliance communities have confirmed strong interest in the lessons being designed for Author Carpentry. 

#Topics covered in Author Carpentry include

* Scientific writing in useful, powerful, and open mark-up languages such as LaTeX and Markdown; 

* Formulating and managing references, publication lists, and bibliographies in open formats such as BiBTeX and in open tools such as JabRef;

* Establishing scholarly identity with ORCiD and managing reputation with ORCiD-enabled research information systems (ImpactStory, OpenVIVO) 

* Determining authorship, contributorship, and copyright ownership in collaborative research projects

* Demonstrating best practices in attribution, acknowledgement, and citation, particularly for non-traditional research outputs (software, datasets)

* Identifying reputable Open Access publications

* Scholarly annotation and open peer review

* Investigating and managing copyright status of a work, and evaluating conditions for Fair Use

* Open sharing of research using Creative Commons licenses, waivers, and public domain marks
