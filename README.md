#Author Carpentry                ![Author Carpentry Logo](AClogo.jpg)

Welcome to the master repository for [Author Carpentry] (http://libguides.caltech.edu/authorcarpentry), a training and outreach initiative  of the Caltech Library to enhance scientific authorship and publishing in the digital age. The aim of Author Carpentry is to promote and support good information handling tools, practices, and skills that help researchers prepare, submit, and publish contributions that add value to the scholarly record and invite others to adapt and build upon. Ideally, that means contributions that fulfill not only the original Big Four of the scientific paper --

1. Registration

2. Validation

3. Dissemination

4. Preservation

**But also enable an essential fifth component of knowledge management in the digital age**:

  5\. Replication, Reuse, and Remixing

In conceiving of the Author Carpentry program, our hope is to advance production and curation of the *Research Paper of the Future*, crafted as a fully open, executable, reproducible, reusable contribution ready to be rendered, tested, mined, adapted, and built upon by humans and machines. 

Author Carpentry lessons are agnostic to the mode of 'publication', recognizing that the term connotes a range of dissemination choices in the Internet Age (self-archiving in a pre-print server, sharing via a reputable online repository, micro publication on a blog, tweet, or other web service, or by peer-reviewed journal or refereed book.) They are also agnostic to any particular tool or platform to get a task done, though our lessons do incorporate the use of selected tools we are comfortatble using at Caltech. Generally speaking, any tool we do use in a lesson can easily be replaced by something equivalent, and our reference to a given tool in no way represents endorsement by Caltech.

##Connection between Author Carpentry and Software/Data Carpentry

Author Carpentry is not an official Software/Data Carpentry project but it draws inspiration and encouragement from those sucessful communities that model  high impact instructional design, effective peer to peer teaching, and sensible assessment. We aim to build on the success of Software and Data Carpentry in promoting and teaching "good enough" skills for research information handling beyond software and code. SWC founder Greg Wilson's draft lesson [Modern Scientific Authoring] (http://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/01-mess.html) speaks to the need for training in writing, publishing, citation, and more. Discussions with members of the Carpentry and Research Data Alliance communities, and input from the June 2-3 2016 Mozilla Science Sprint, have confirmed broad interest in the lessons being designed for Author Carpentry. 

##Why would Librarians be involved in Carpentry?

Research librarians have long shared expertise in authoring and publishing with our campus communities, and we have developed considerable expertise in knowledge management principles and practices; instruction and assessment; information ethics and law, responsible conduct of research; and research information systems. But we haven't always been successful in reaching busy, productive researchers with little time to spend on subjects outside their own discplinary work. So the Caltech Library is recasting its instructional program using a 'Carpentry' approach to better meet the needs of successful, time-constrained, and (understandably) often pre-occupied scientists and scholars. The desired outcome is a set of pragmatic, efficient and useful Author Carpentry lessons that can be offered alone as 'tips and tools' sessions; in combination as a half-day or full-day workshop; or as snap-on modules to enhance existing SW/D Carpentry programs. 

##Topics covered in Author Carpentry include

* Scientific writing in useful, powerful, and open mark-up languages such as LaTeX and Markdown; 

* Formulating and managing references, publication lists, and bibliographies in open formats such as BiBTeX and using open source tools such as JabRef;

* Establishing scholarly identity with ORCiD and managing reputation with ORCiD-enabled research information systems (ImpactStory, OpenVIVO) 

* Determining authorship, contributorship, and copyright ownership in collaborative research projects

* Demonstrating best practices in attribution, acknowledgement, and citation, particularly for non-traditional research outputs (software, datasets)

* Identifying reputable Open Access publications

* Scholarly annotation and open peer review

* Investigating and managing copyright status of a work, and evaluating conditions for Fair Use

* Open sharing of research using Creative Commons licenses, waivers, and public domain marks

##Get Involved
AuthorCarpentry is an Open Project and we enthusiastically welcome contributions of librarian and other research professionals. Anyone with an interest in the material is welcome to take part. The project is being co-ordinated by [Gail Clement](gclement@library.caltech.edu) at Caltech Library. Plesae get in touch or register your ideas on the Issues section.
