<h2>LESSON TWO: OPEN CITATIONS and BibTeX FORMAT (Under Heavy Construction!)</h2>
<section>
<hr>
<h2>Module 2A. Introducing Open Citations</h2>
<hr>
Citations are a special type of research data that provide a succinct representation of a scholarly work in a standard format. Citation styles and syntaxes differ across resource types, subject disciplines and information systems, but generally have a common kernel of elements:
<ul>
<li>Creator/Author(s)</li>
<li>Title of work</li>
<li>Publisher of work</li>
<li>Publication date</li>
<li>Extent/page range</li>
<li>Locator (where to retrieve the work)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional elements that information providers may also include in their citation data are subject descriptors, keywords, geographic 
or chronological coverage of the work, funder information, copyright and licensing statements, and so on.</p>

<p>Citation data is critical to research and scholarship because: 
<ol>
    
<li>it permits attribution to works that an author draws on and incorporates into her own writings</li>
<li>it allows the research community to aggregate and integrate the contributions of all contributors into a useful system for search, 
retrieval, tracking, assessment, and reporting. </li>
</ol>
<p>Citation data forms the basis of publication lists on researcher websites; the core of a professional CV, a required section of a grant 
application, and represent essential data in research information systems such as ORCiD and the DOI Registry.
</p>

Yet much of the citation data associated with the scholarly record remains under the control of commercial aggregators and publishers, requiring researchers (or their libraries) to pay for costly annual subscriptions. Even when paid, these subscriptions restrict reuse and redistribution of the citation data for many research uses. And often times, the format of the citation is proprietary to a commercially owned reference manager system such as EndNote or RefWorks. Intiatives to develop an Open Citation Corpus for free access and reuse has been discussed and attempted (Shotten 2013) but as of this time there is no single comprehensive source of open access citations to the scholarly literature.

This lesson is an effort to promote Open Citation practices, services, and tools. It highlights citation data and formats that freely available for downloading, editing and enhancing, reusing, and redistributing by researchers. It introduces tools to transform and combine open citations into

This lesson introduces an effective and efficient "open science" approach for creating and maintaining a reference list that can be re-used in research-related systems such as the ORCiD Profile. It relies on the open citation format BibTeX and command line tools to retrieve and combine citations from multiple sources.
By maintaining a 'master' pubs list in a consistent, open, plain text citation format, a researcher can re-purpose the citation data for reuse in different systems and services.


Introduction to Citation Formats and BibTeX
Exercise 2A. Compare the formatting differences between xxx and BibTeX formats for the same citation

Exercise 2B. Download a selected reference from a free online citation database and save it in BibTeX format

Point your web browser to the Google Scholar Profile for Richard Feynman at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B7vSqZsAAAAJ

On the entry for Theory of Fermi interaction, click on the title to go to the landing page for that citation.

Click on the 'Export' button and choose 'BibTeX'. A file called citations.bib will download to your computer.

Repeat the same step for another citation on the list: (a book). This will save to your computer ... Save and rename the file for reuse in a later step: $mv citations.bib cite2.bib

View the citation to familiarize yourself with BibTeX format $cat cite2.bib

Point your web browser to the Google Scholar Profile for Richard Feynman at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B7vSqZsAAAAJ

On the entry for Theory of Fermi interaction, click on the title to go to the landing page for that citation.

Click on the 'Export' button and choose 'BibTeX'. A file called citations.bib will download to your computer.

Repeat the same step for another citation on the list: (a book). This will save to your computer ... Save and rename the file for reuse in a later step: $mv citations.bib cite2.bib

Exercise 2B: Fetch a citation in MLA style from an open access library catalog, transform it to BibTeX format, and save for later reuse

$curl -L -S -S http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 >redirect1.txt

$grep "<title>" redirect1.txt

$ curl -L -s -S http://dx.doi.org/10.7935/K5H41PBP >redirect2.txt

$grep "<title>" redirect2.txt

Exercise 2C. Build a reference list from open citations for ready ingest into BIBTeX-compatible systems

$ cat cite1.bib cite2.bib cite.bib>feynman.bib

Open the file feynman.bib to make sure it is clean and ready to be ingested by a BibTeX-compatible system. $vi feynman.bib Type :wq to exit and save the file.

In the Lesson 3, we will ingest the BibTeX file into a LaTeX authoring platform where we will reference each entry in the list in a new manuscript about Richard Feynman.

<h2>Module 2B. xxx</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.doi.org/">International DOI System</a> is the overall infrastructure by which Digital Object Identifiers are assigned, registered, resolved, and associated with valuable metadata including citation, availability of full text, funder information,  licensing information, and more. 
The following components of the DOI System together make it work:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html">International DOI Federation (IDF)</a> is responsible for the overall governance of the system. IDF is a not-for-profit membership organization that oversees the operations of the federation of Registration Agencies which provide Digital Object Identifier (DOI) services and registration. 
IDF is also the registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI system.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html">Registration Agencies (RAs)</a> provide services to Registrants (or Members) â€” allocating DOI name prefixes, registering DOI names and providing the necessary infrastructure to allow Registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. 
Each RA must follow basic protocols and standards of the DOI sytem, including  a minimum metadata standard known as the DOI kernel. 
Yet each RA has the freedom to implement additional metadata standards, track a range of information about a given DOI resource, and offer public services for querying their databases.  
As an example, the Registration Agency CrossRef registers a range of metadata about scholarly resources including funding data, license associated with the digital object, author data including ORCiD numbers, and more -- 
see April Ondis' CrossRef Blog posting "<a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/06/beyond-the-doi-to-richer-metadata.html">Beyond the DOI to richer metadata</a>" for more info about their services.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The metadata associated with the DOI is often rich enough to provide useful data for a researcher. This lesson and the next look at the array of useful public data associated with DOIs.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2B(1). Demonstrate that a DOI redirects to the web landing page for an associated information resource</h3>

<pre>
    
$curl http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.109.193

$ curl -s -S http://dx.doi.org/10.7935/K5H41PBP

$ curl http://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.9751
</pre>

<h3>Exercise 2B(2). Given a DOI, determine which Registration Agency issued it</h3>

<pre>
$ curl http://doi.crossref.org/doiRA/10.5170/CERN-2000-001.101

$ curl http://doi.crossref.org/doiRA/10.5170/CERN-2000-001.101, 10.2307/1578389
</pre>

[<em>Note that this lookup service is provided by one of the DOI Agencies, CrossRef,
yet the query also works for DOIs issued by other Agencies!  
Each DOI Agency provides various services beyond registering and maintaining DOIs; 
savvy researchers may wish to check with more than one agency to get relevant information.</em>
 

<h3>Exercise 2B(3). Retrieve a list of DataCite members</h3>

<h3>Exercise 2B(4). Determine what information resource is associated with a given DOI</h3>
<hr>
<h2>Module 2C.xxx</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    

<p>Researchers may search for metadata associated with DOIs in various ways.  
This module demonstrates how to use the API services of two Registration Agencies -- CrossRef and DataCite -- to query and retrieve valuable metadata about research outputs. 
The commands demonstrated use the process of DOI Content Negotiation to retrieve different representations of a work from the API service.
</p>
<h3>Exercise 2C(1). Query the Registration Agency API to retrieve a citation for a published article</h3>

<pre>
    
$curl http://api.crossref.org/works/http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 > cite1.txt 

$less cite1.txt

</pre>

<em>Now use Content Negotation to specify a particular format for the citation.</em>

<pre>
    
$curl -LH "Accept:text/bibliography; style=bibtex" http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 > cite1.bib

$cat cite1.bib
</pre>

<em>Keep this citation for Lesson 2, where we add it to a publications list to include in a new research paper.</em>
<hr>
<h3>Module 1D. How do I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for my material?</h3>
<hr>

<p>You have a few options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the services of an existing Registrant, such as a Publisher, Library, or Data Center who is assisting you with
disseminating and preserving your research outputs.</li> 

<li>If you aren't working with one of these RAs, you can submit your work to an open research sharing system such as Zenodo where your ubmission is assigned a DOI, archived, and disseminated over the open Web.
</li>

<li><Alternatively, your organization can join a DOI Registration Agency (RA) and become a DOI Registrant. This commitment requires an investment of time, infrastructure, funds, and human resources to ensure that registered DOIs are maintained and revised as content changes or moves. Information about becoming a DOI registration is available from the DOI Foundation.
</li>
    
    </ul>
    
[<em>
Note that Zenodo does offer an API service which can be used via Python with the Requests package installed.  
Advanced registration with Zenodo is necessary to obtain a authorization token to include in requests.</em>]
